This asks you to write an algorithm to determine the lowest-cost seam used for a particular kind of image compression.
For this assignment, it's enough to compute the cost of the lowest-cost seam. 
You will compute the seam itself in the next problem set. 
I'm asking you to write the algorithm and then to write a program implementing it. 
As you know by now, write a method to do this, along with top-level code to call the method. 
I will supply a data file containing the pixel disruption values (this is the d table mentioned in the problem description). 
Call the program either Seam.java or seam.py. Please also answer part (a), 
which asks you to show that the number of possible seams is at least exponential. Put this answer into the porgram comments.
